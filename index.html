        <h2>Try it out</h2>
        <p>
          You can play the game from your browser. Tested on desktop (Chrome,
          Firefox, firefox gives better FPS), iPhone (starting from 7th model)
          (Safari), iPad (request mobile site)
        </p>

          1. <strong>iPhone users </strong> -> go first to
          <a href="setup.html">setup page</a>, and grant permission to motion
          sensor, and make sure you can navigate by moving your phone
        </p>
        <p>
          - 1.1 I would recommend pressing "aA" in Safari and selecting "hide
          toolbar", for more immersive feeling. Do this before pressing "VR"
          button in bottom right corner -> otherwise you'll see double picture
          in VR headset
        </p>
        <p>
          2. <strong>Android</strong> -> go straight to the game.
          <strong
            >NB! in our tests most Androids didn't interact successfully with VR
            (noizy sensor data) or had too low FPS</strong
          >. If that's the case for you - we're sorry, you can still check the
          video/use your computer
        </p>

          Dealing with pain and treatment anxiety is challenging, especially for
          kids.
        </p>
        <p>
          Research proves that Virtual Reality (VR) experience can reduce pain
          and anxiety during procedures. It's applied already in certain
          <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/hplab/research/virtual-reality/"
            >hospitals</a
          >, but using traditional VR headsets is out of reach for many still.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's why we think it's crucial to bring this tool to more people, by
          building VR game that can be used on any device, right from the
          browser. Tune in to see what we've built during the weekend at
          Junction Connected 2020!

        <blockquote>
          "VR pain reduction, or analgesia, works by acting on that age old
          platitude "pain is in the mind," or rather the academic version, "pain
          requires conscious attention." -

          Unfortunately, WebVR might not work smoothly on all Android
          devices/browsers. If you get glitchy/laggy experience you can try
          another browser,try on your computer, or watch demo video below!
